# MACHINE LEARNING INTERN

# Description
This project aims to implement machine learning models for three tasks: SMS spam detection, movie genre classification, and customer churn classification.

# Usage
To use this project:

# Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the main scripts for each task.
# Data
The datasets used in this project are:

SMS Spam Collection Dataset for SMS spam detection.
IMDB Movie Dataset for movie genre classification.
Customer Churn Dataset for customer churn classification.

# Models
For each task, the following models were implemented:

SMS Spam Detection: Naive Bayes Classifier, Logistic Regression
Movie Genre Classification: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression
Customer Churn Classification: Logistic Regression,Random Forest

# Results
The performance metrics for each task are as follows:

# SMS Spam Detection:

Accuracy: 98%
F1 Score: 0.95

# Movie Genre Classification:

Accuracy: 85%
Precision: 0.84
Recall: 0.86

# Customer Churn Classification:

Accuracy: 75%
Precision: 0.74
Recall: 0.76
